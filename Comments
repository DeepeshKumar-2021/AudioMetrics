I am not abe to get the "Audio Level" metric as I did not find any way to get it from RTP module.
From RTP module we can get Audio Level only if header extension is supported.

I did not find way to get it from other modules.
About jitter buffer, as per my analysis of code, I feel it is better handled for video compare to voice/audio.
